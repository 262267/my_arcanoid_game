## General info
The Arkanoid game was created in connection with passing the subject at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology on the field of Applied mathematics. I hope you will enjoy this game!

## Technologies
In the project I use:
* python version: 3.8.5
* pygame version: 2.0.1
* pygame_menu version: 4.0.6
* python Random library 

## Instruction
To play this game you have to click "Play" button in game menu. Then just click SPACE to move the ball up. If you want to control the paddle just click LEFT and RIGHT arrow. There are also some options there:
* you can choose the level (the more difficult it is, the smaller the paddle)
* it is possible to change the colors of paddle, ball and blocks 
* if you want, you can switch on/off the sound and sound effect in menu
